CONOPT is a nonlinear solver written by Arne Drud.
It is based on the reduced gradient method.

Command-line arguments to conopt either have the form

        keywd=
or
        keywd=value

where keywd is one of the keywords described below, or is the name
of a CONOPT "CR-Cell" (as described in separate CONOPT documentation).
Alternatively, you can invoke conopt the way AMPL's solve command does,
i.e.,

        conopt stub -AMPL [keywd=value ...]

where stub was specified in

        ampl -obstub ...
or
        ampl -ogstub...

Such an invocation causes conopt to read from stub.nl and to write stub.sol.

------------------
Controlling conopt
------------------

Conopt reads keywords and values from the environment (shell) variable
conopt_options and from the command line.  Case is ignored.  For logical
CR-Cells, use 0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE.  Here are the non-CR-Cell
keywords that conopt understands; fp indicates a floating-point value
and none indicates a keyword that appears by itself, without a value.

        Keyword         Value           Meaning

        debug           integer         When to use finite differences to
                                        check derivatives:
                                                 0  ==> never (default);
                                                -1  ==> only at the starting point;
                                                > 0 ==> every that many iterations.

        debug2d         integer         When to use finite differences to check the
                                        Lagrangian Hessian:
                                                 0  (default) ==> never;
                                                -1  ==> only at the starting point;
                                                > 0 ==> every that many iterations.

        errlim          integer         Evaluation-error limit (default 500).
                                        If the objective or constraints cannot be
                                        evaluated at a proposed next iterate, CONOPT
                                        will try a shorter step at most errlim times.

        hess            integer         whether to use the Lagrangian Hessian:
                                                0 = no;
                                                1 = yes: just the explicit Hessian;
                                                2 = yes: just Hessian-vector products;
                                                3 = yes (default): use both explicit
                                                        and Hessian-vector products;
                                                -1 = no, but evaluate gradients as for
                                                        Hessian computations
                                                        (debug option).

Sample Invocations
------------------

  If you're using AMPL, just say

        option solver conopt;
        solve;

  If you've executed, say,

        ampl -objunk junk.model junk.data

then you could say

        conopt junk maxiter=300 rtmaxj=1e20

to force conopt to run for at most 300 iterations with CR-Cell rtmaxj
set to 1e20.  Either of the invocations

        conopt_options='maxiter=300 rtmaxj=1e20' conopt junk

or (using Bourne-shell notation)

        conopt_options='iterations=300 rtmaxj=1e20'
        export conopt_options
        conopt junk

would have the same effect; within AMPL, specifying

        option conopt_options 'iterations=300 rtmaxj=1e20', solver conopt;
        solve;

would also have this effect.
